Welcome to the all in one Mekanism Multiblock Controller using CC.
My name is DarknessARises1 but i go by Dark to most people. I wanted an all in one CC controller for my Mekanism Multiblocks to watch my stuff and control them from one place.
Due to this i created this program, im constantly working on it and updating it, check back every once in a while for a new verison!
Right now it currently connects to and reads Fusion Reactors, Turbines, Boilers, Thermal Evaporaters, Dynamic Tanks, and SPS.
There is a turbine main summary panel that lets you controll and see the output of all your turbines from one cell.
You can adjust the cell layout in the config, it will first launch when you start the program and you can config it inside the program by either touching the button on the monitor or clicking it on the terminal.
I will be working on adding a pocket controller using a pocket computer that will communicate to the main terminal so you can remotely control this stuff as well.
Also for the setup of the sps on/off controls, you need to link a redstone output to the back of the terminal to the connected energy pipe to your sps valve to turn on and off that pipe.


Current Pastebin is JVQHZDvV
